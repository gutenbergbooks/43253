<h2>AN ELECTION ADDRESS.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard</span> has become the accepted Conservative candidate
for a Norfolk constituency. The following is understood to be an advance
copy of his Address.]</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Intelligent electors, may I venture to present</p>
<p>Myself as an aspirant for a seat in Parliament?</p>
<p>The views of those opponents who despise a novelist,</p>
<p>Are but the foggy arguments of People of the Mist!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>No writer, I assure you, can produce a better claim,</p>
<p>A greater versatility, a more substantial fame;</p>
<p>My candidature, though opposed by all the yellow gang,</p>
<p>Has won the hearty sympathy of Mr. <span class="smcap">Andrew Lang</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And if what my opinions are you&#39;d really like to know,</p>
<p>They&#39;re issued at a modest price by <span class="smcap">Longmans, Green, &amp;amp; Co.</span>;</p>
<p>The Eight Hours Bill, for instance, I&#39;m prepared to speak upon</p>
<p>From a practical acquaintance with the Mines of Solomon.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Whatever my intentions as to Woman&#39;s Rights may be,</p>
<p>I yield to none in honouring the great immortal She;</p>
<p>While, as to foreign policy, though Blue Books make you yawn,</p>
<p>You&#39;ll find the subject treated most attractively in <i>Dawn</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>When I am placed in Parliament, I&#39;ll speak with fluent skill,</p>
<p>And show (like Mr. <span class="smcap">Meeson</span>) I&#39;ve a most effective will;</p>
<p>And if there is a special point for which I mean to fight,</p>
<p>It is for legislation to protect my copyright.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>If chance debate to matters in South Africa should tend,</p>
<p>My anecdotes will cause the Speaker&#39;s wig to stand on end;</p>
<p>And if an opportunity occurs, I&#39;ll rouse the lot</p>
<p>By perorating finely in impassioned Hottentot!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>So, Gentlemen, I beg you, let my arguments prevail,</p>
<p>Shame would it be if such a cause through apathy should fail,</p>
<p>Shame on the false elector who his honest duty shirks!</p>

<h2>&quot;WHEN ARTHUR FIRST AT COURT.&quot;</h2>

<p class="indent">Last week the Court Theatre was advertised as a &quot;Company,
Limited.&quot; The cast in the bill was given as Chairman, <span class="smcap">Arthur
W. Pinero</span>; First Director, Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan</span> (with a song?);
Second Director, <span class="smcap">Herbert Bennett</span> (Director also of <span class="smcap">Harrod&#39;s</span>
Stores, Limited, the success of which establishment has been so great
as to now out-<span class="smcap">Harrod Harrod</span>); and then <span class="smcap">Arthur Chudleigh</span>
(who was jointly lessee at one time with Mrs. <span class="smcap">John Wood</span>), as
Director and Acting Manager. The Solicitor is down as <span class="smcap">Arthur
B. Chubb</span> (&quot;little fish are sweet&quot;), and the Secretary is Mr. <span class="smcap">A.</span>
(presumably <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>?) <span class="smcap">S. Dunn</span>. Most appropriate this name to
finish with; &quot;and now my story&#39;s <span class="smcap">Dunn</span>.&quot; Fortunate omen,
too, that there are two &quot;n&#39;s&quot; in <span class="smcap">Dunn</span>, which otherwise is a word
associated with a Court not quite so cheerful as the Court Theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">But the curious note about it is the preponderance of &quot;<span class="smcap">Arthurs</span>.&quot;
<span class="smcap">Arthur Pinero</span>, <span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan</span>, <span class="smcap">Arthur Chudleigh</span>, <span class="smcap">Arthur
Chubb</span>, and <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> (?) <span class="smcap">Dunn</span>. If they have power to add to their
number, why not take in <span class="smcap">Arthur Jones</span>, <span class="smcap">Arthur Lloyd</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Arthur Roberts</span>? That would make the Dramatic <span class="smcap">Arthurs</span> and
the Musical <span class="smcap">Arthurs</span> about equal.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Matilda Charlotte Wood</span> is mentioned as having had an agreement
with one of the <span class="smcap">Arthurs</span> yclept <span class="smcap">Chudleigh</span>, and probably
also a disagreement too, as their once highly prosperous joint
management came to an end. But now &quot;she will return,&quot; at least,
everyone hopes so, as, after her capital performance of the Sporting
Duchess at Drury Lane, she has shown us that she is as fresh and
as great an attraction as ever. Some of the <span class="smcap">Arthurs</span> will write for
her, one <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> will compose for her, two <span class="smcap">Arthurs</span> will act and
sing with her, and <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, the managing director, will direct and
manage her. May every success attend the venture! But how
about authors and composers offering their work to so professional
a board of directors? Doesn&#39;t <i>Sir Fretful Plagiary&#39;s</i> objection to
sending his play in to the manager of Drury Lane, namely, that
&quot;he writes himself.&quot; hold good nowadays? Hum. A difficulty,
most decidedly; still, not absolutely insuperable.</p>

<h2>&quot;THE &#39;KEY-NOTE&#39;-ORIOUS MRS. EBBSMITH.&quot;</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:50%;">
<a href="images/148a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/148a.png"
alt=""/></a>
<h3>The Dowdy Mrs. Ebbsmith makes it hot for her young man.</h3>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Pinero&#39;s</span> new play at the Garrick Theatre is a series of scenes
in dialogue with only one &quot;situation,&quot; which comes at the end of the
third act, and was evidently intended to be utterly unconventional,
dreadfully daring, and thrillingly effective. &quot;Unconventional?&quot;
Yes. &quot;Daring?&quot; Certainly; for to burn a bible might have
raised a storm of sibilation. But why dare so much to effect so
little? For at the reading, or during rehearsal, there must have
been very considerable hesitation felt by everybody, author included,
as to the fate of this risky situation&mdash;this &quot;<i>momentum unde pendet</i>&quot;&mdash;and
for which nothing, either in the character or in the previous
history of the heroine, has prepared us. Her earliest years have
been passed in squalor; she has made a miserable marriage; then she
has become a Socialist ranter, and hopes to achieve a triumph as a
Socialist demagogue. Like Maypole Hugh in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> she
would go about the world shrieking &quot;No property! No property!&quot;
and when, in a weak moment, she consents to temporarily drop her
&quot;mission,&quot; she goes to another extreme and comes out in an evening
dress&mdash;I might say almost comes out <i>of</i> an evening dress, so egregiously
<i>décolleté</i> is it&mdash;to please the peculiar and, apparently, low taste
of her lover, who is a married man,&mdash;&quot;which well she knows it,&quot; as
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span> observes,&mdash;but with whom she is living, and with whom,
like <span class="smcap">Grant Allen&#39;s</span> <i>The Woman who did</i> (a lady whom in many
respects Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinero&#39;s</span> heroine closely resembles), and who came to
grief in doing it, she intends to continue living. This man, her
paramour, she trusts will be her partner in the socialistic regeneration
of the human race. At the close of the third act <i>Mrs. Ebbsmith</i>,
being such as the author of her being has made her, is
presented with a bible, and, in a fit of ungovernable fury, she
pitches it into the stove &quot;with all her might and main&quot;; and then
it suddenly occurs to her that she has committed some terrible
crime (more probably it occurred to the author that <i>he</i> had committed
the unpardonable sin of offending his audience)&mdash;and so she
shoots out her arm into a nice, cool-looking stove (suggestive of
no sort of danger to her or the book), and drags out the pocket volume
apparently quite as uninjured as is her own hand at the moment,
though this is subsequently carefully bound up with a white handkerchief
in the last act. Well&mdash;that&#39;s all. There is <i>the</i> situation.
The Key-note-orious <i>Mrs. Ebbsmith</i> is supposed to repent of her
sins against society; and off she goes to become the companion of the
unmarried parson and of the lively widow his sister. What the result
of this arrangement will be is pretty clear. The Key-note-orious
One will soon be the parson&#39;s bride; but &quot;that is another story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To carry out this drama of inaction, as it is schemed, should occupy
eight persons something under two hours; but it takes thirteen persons
three hours to carry it along. Five of these <i>dramatis personæ</i>
are superfluous; and much time is wasted on dialogues in Italian and
French that could be &quot;faked up&quot; from any conversation-book in
several languages, and evidently only lugged in under the mistaken
impression that thereby a touch of &quot;local colour&quot; is obtained.</p>

<p class="indent">As it is the audience wearies of the long speeches, and there is
nothing in the action that can rouse them as there was in <i>The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray</i>, a play that Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinero</span> has not yet
equalled, much less surpassed.</p>

<p class="indent">But what is a real pleasure, and what will attract all
lovers of good acting, is, first of all, Mr. <span class="smcap">Forbes Robertson&#39;s</span>
admirable impersonation of the difficult, unsympathetic
<i>rôle</i> of a despicably selfish, self-conceited, cowardly
prig; and, secondly, to a certain extent, the rendering of
the heroine by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Patrick Campbell</span>, who, however, does
not come within measurable distance of her former self as
<i>Mrs. Tanqueray</i>&mdash;her &quot;great stove scene&quot; being about the
weakest point in her performance. But there cannot be a
divided opinion as to the perfect part given to Mr. <span class="smcap">John
Hare</span>, and as to the absolutely perfect manner in which it is
played by this consummate artist in character. All the scenes
in which he appears are admirably conceived by the author,
and as admirably interpreted by the actor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;">

alt=""/></a>
<h3>Transformation Scene. The Rowdy-Dowdy Mrs. Ebbsmith fascinates
the Dook.</h3>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare&#39;s</span> performance of the <i>Duke of St. Olpherts</i> is a
real gem, ranking among the very best things he has ever
done, and I may even add &quot;going one better.&quot; It is on his
acting, and on the acting of the scenes in which he appears,
that the ultimate popularity of the piece must depend. The
theatrical stove-cum-book situation may tell with some
audiences better than with others, but it is not an absolute
certainty; while every scene in which the <i>Duke of St.
Olpherts</i> takes part, as long as this character is played by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare</span>, is in itself an absolute isolated triumph. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Aubrey Smith</span>, as the modern young English moustached
parson, <i>en voyage</i>, with his pipe, and bible in his pocket (is
he a <i>colporteur</i> of some Biblical Society, with a percentage on
the sale? otherwise the book is an awkward size to carry
about, especially if he has also a <i>Murray</i> with him), is very
true to life, at all events in manner and appearance; and
Miss <span class="smcap">Jeffreys</span>, as his sister, who looks just as if she had
walked out of a fashion-plate in <i>The Gentlewoman</i>, or some
lady&#39;s journal, plays discreetly and with considerable self-repression.
Of course it will remain one of the notable pieces
of the year; but what will keep it green in the memory of
playgoers is not the story, nor its heroine, nor its hero, but the captivating

<h2>THE GAME OF DRAUGHTS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By One who has Played it.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">Assume that I am living in Yokohama
Gardens (before the pleasant change from
winter to spring), and that I am conscious of
the near approach of the North Pole. The fires
in the grates seem to be lukewarm, and even
the coals are frozen. My servants have told
me that the milk had to be melted before it
could adorn the breakfast-table; and as for
the butter, it is as hard as marble. There is
only one thing to do, to send for that worthy
creature Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span>, an individual &quot;who
can turn his hand to anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well Sir,&quot; Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span> arrives and observes
after a few moments spent in careful
consideration of the subject from various
points of view, &quot;of course you feel the cold
because there is five-and-twenty degrees of
frost just outside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I admit that Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside&#39;s</span> opinion is reasonable;
and call his attention to the fact that a
newspaper which is lying on the floor some five
yards from a closed door is violently agitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see Sir,&quot; says he promptly. &quot;If you
will wait a moment I will tell you more
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He takes off his coat, throws down a bag
of tools (his chronic companion), and lies flat
on the floor. Then he places his right ear to
the ground and listens intently, pointing the
while to the newspaper that has now ceased
to suffer from agitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are, Sir!&quot; he exclaims
triumphantly. &quot;There&#39;s a draught there.
I could feel it distinctly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rises from the ground, reassumes his
overcoat, and once more possesses himself of
his bag of useful instruments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what shall I do?&quot; I ask.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you see Sir, it&#39;s not for the likes of
me to advise gentry folk like you. I wouldn&#39;t
think of presuming upon such a liberty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all, Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span>,&quot; I explain with
some anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Sir&mdash;mind you, if it&#39;s not taking
too much of a liberty&mdash;I would, having
draughts, get rid of them. And you have
draughts about, now haven&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I hasten to assure him that I am convinced
that my house is a perfect nest of draughts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you be too sure until I have tested
them,&quot; advises Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the ingenious creature again divests
himself of his overcoat and workman&#39;s bag
and commences his labours. He visits every
door in the house and tries it. He assumes
all sorts of attitudes. Now he appears like
<span class="smcap">Jessie Brown</span> at Lucknow listening to the
distant slogan of the coming Highlanders.
Now like a colleague of <span class="smcap">Guy Fawkes</span> noting
the tread of Lord <span class="smcap">Monteagle</span> on the road to
the gunpowder cellar beneath the Houses of
Parliament. His attitudes, if not exactly
graceful, are full of character.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are draughts everywhere,&quot; says
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span>, having come to the end of his
investigations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what shall I do?&quot; I ask for the
second time. Again my worthy inspector
spends a few minutes in self-communing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not for the likes of a poor man like
me, Sir, to give advice; but if I were you,
Sir, I would say antiplutocratic tubing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is antiplutocratic tubing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Sir, it&#39;s as good a thing as you
can have, under all the circumstances. But
don&#39;t have antiplutocratic tubing because I
say so. I may be wrong, Sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span>,&quot; I reply, in a tone
of encouragement. &quot;I am sure you are right.
Do you think you could get me some antiplutocratic
tubing, and put it up for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, of course I could, Sir!&quot; returns
my worthy helper, in the tone of a more than
usually benevolent Father Christmas. Then
he seems to lose heart and become despondent.
&quot;But there, Sir, it&#39;s not for the likes of me to
say anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">However, I persuade Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span> to take
a more cheerful view of his position, and to
undertake the job.</p>

<p class="indent">For the next three hours there is much
hammering in all parts of the house. My
neighbours must imagine that I have
taken violently to spiritual manifestations.
Wherever I wander I find my worthy assistant
hard at work covering the borders of the doors
with a material that looks like elongated eels
in a condition of mummification&mdash;if I may
be permitted to use such an expression. Now
he is standing on a ledge level with the hall
lamp; now he is reclining sideways beside
an entrance-protecting rug; now he is hanging
by the bannisters midway between two
landings. The day grows apace. It is soon
afternoon, and rapidly becomes night. When
the lights are beginning to appear in the
streets without, Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span> has done. My
house is rescued from the draughts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t be troubled much more, Sir,&quot;
says he, as he glances contemptuously at a
door embedded in antiplutocratic tubing.
&quot;Keep those shut and the draughts won&#39;t get
near you&mdash;at least so I think, although I may
be wrong. Thank you, Sir. Quite correct.
Good evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he leaves me, muffled up in his overcoat,
and still clinging to his basket, with its
burden of saws, hammers, chisels, and nails
of various dimensions. I enter the dining-room
with an air of satisfaction as I hear his
echoing footsteps on the pavement without,
and attempt to close the door. It will do
almost everything, but it won&#39;t shut. I give
up the dining-room, and enter my study.
Again, I try to close the door. But no; it
has caught the infection of its neighbour and
also declines to close. I try the doors of the
drawing-room, bedroom, and the dressing-room.
But no, my efforts are in vain. None
of them will close. The wind howls, and the
draughts rush in with redoubled fury. They
triumph meanly in my despair.</p>

<p class="indent">There is only one thing to do, and I determine
to do it. I must send for Mr. <span class="smcap">Lopside</span>
to take away as soon as possible his antiplutocratic
tubing. After all he was right
when he had those, alas! unheeded misgivings.
He said &quot;he might be wrong&quot;&mdash;and was!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;Demand and Supply!&quot; So economists cry,</p>
<p class="i2">And one, they assure us, must balance the other.</p>
<p><i>I</i> fancy their doctrines are just all my eye,</p>
<p class="i2">But then I&#39;m a victim of bad times and bother.</p>
<p>At least, friend Aquarius, <i>you</i>&#39;ll understand</p>
<p class="i2">That Jack Frost and you have between you upset me.</p>
<p>You are down on me&mdash;ah! like a shot&mdash;with Demand,</p>
<p class="i2">But as to Supply&mdash;ah! that&#39;s just where you get me.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Water? You frosty old fraud, not a drop,</p>
<p class="i2">Save what I have purchased from urchins half frozen,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had for six weeks for my house and my shop,</p>
<p class="i2">And they tell me the six weeks <i>may</i> swell to a dozen!</p>
<p>Call <i>that</i> Water-Supply, Mister Mulberry Nose?</p>
<p class="i2">Why, your oozy old eyelids seem winking in mockery,</p>
<p>My cisterns are empty, my pipes frozen close,</p>
<p class="i2">I&#39;ve nothing for washing my hands, clothes or crockery.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>As to flushing my drain-pipes, or sinks, why you know,</p>
<p class="i2">I might as well trust the Sahara for sluicing.</p>
<p>A bath? Yes, at tuppence a pailful or so.</p>
<p class="i2">Good gracious! we grudge every tumbler we&#39;re using.</p>
<p>Your stand-pipes and tanks compensate for such pranks?</p>
<p class="i2">Get out! You <i>are</i> playing it low down, Aquarius.</p>
<p>Be grateful for mercies so small, Sir? No thanks!</p>
<p class="i2">My wrongs at your hands have been many and various.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But these last six weeks, Sir, are just the last straw</p>
<p class="i2">That break the strong back of the rate-paying camel,</p>
<p>I do not quite know what&#39;s the state of the law,</p>
<p class="i2">But <i>if</i> yours is all freedom, and mine is all trammel,</p>
<p>If yours is Demand, and mine is <i>not</i> Supply,</p>
<p class="i2">As &#39;twould seem by the look of that precious rate-paper,</p>
<p>Aquarius, old boy, I have plans in my eye</p>
<p class="i2">For checking your pretty monopolist caper.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Pay up, and look pleasant? Ah yes, that&#39;s my rule</p>
<p class="i2">For every impost, from Poor Rate to Income.</p>
<p>But paying for what you don&#39;t get fits a fool,</p>
<p class="i2">Besides, you old Grampus-Grab, whence will the tin come?</p>
<p>Supply discontinued? Aquarius, <i>that</i> threat,</p>
<p class="i2">Is losing its terrors. I don&#39;t care a penny,</p>
<p>&#39;Twon&#39;t frighten me now into payment, you bet,</p>
<p class="i2">When for the last six weeks I haven&#39;t had any.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Whose fault? Well, we&#39;ll see. But at least you&#39;ll agree</p>
<p class="i2">When Supply&#39;s undertaken, and paid, in advance, for,</p>
<p>A man expects <i>something</i> for his L. S. D.</p>
<p class="i2">Then what have you led me this doose of a dance for?</p>
<p>That question, old Snorter, demands a prompt answer,</p>
<p class="i2">And Taurus expects it of you, my Aquarius,</p>
<p>Or else, Sir, by Gemini, <i>I</i> shall turn Cancer,</p>
<p class="i2">And then the monopolists mayn&#39;t look hilarious.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>How do the Water Rates come to my door?</p>
<p class="i2">&#39;Twould furnish a subject for some brand-new <span class="smcap">Southey</span>.</p>
<p>Your dunning Demand Notes are always a bore,</p>
<p class="i2">But when one is grubby, half frozen and drouthy,</p>
<p>When cisterns are empty and sinks are unflushed,</p>
<p class="i2">And staircases sloppy, and queer smells abounding,</p>
<p>To be by an useless Aquarius rushed</p>
<p class="i2">For &quot;immediate payment&quot; is&mdash;well, it&#39;s astounding.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>How <i>will</i> the water come down through the floor</p>
<p class="i2">When mains are unfrozen and pipes are all &quot;busting&quot;?</p>
<p>Why spurting and squirting, with rush and with roar,</p>
<p class="i2">The wall-papers staining, the fire-irons rusting,</p>
<p>And rushing, and gushing, and flashing and splashing,</p>
<p class="i2">And making a sort of Aix douche of the bedroom,</p>
<p>And comfort destroying, and every hope dashing,</p>
<p class="i2">And leaving one scarce a square yard of dry head-room.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&#39;Twill leak, spirt and trickle, and, oh <i>such</i> a pickle</p>
<p class="i2">Will make of my dwelling, from garret to basement,</p>

<p class="i2">My fancy, and fill me with angry amazement,</p>
<p>To see you mere standing ice-cool, and demanding</p>
<p class="i2">Prompt payment&mdash;for what? Why, long waterless worry!</p>
<p>Aquarius, we <i>must</i> have a fresh understanding;</p>

<h2>THE WOMAN WHO WOULDN&#39;T DO.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>She-Note Series.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">The two were seated in an untrammelled Bohemian sort of way on
the imperturbable expanse of the South Downs. Beneath them was
a carpet of sheep-sorrel, its orbicular perianth being slightly depressed
by their healthy weight. In the distance they noticed thankfully
the saucer-shaped combes of paludina limestone rising in pleasant
strata to the rearing
scarp of the Weald.
<span class="smcap">Perugino Allan</span>
was the gentleman&#39;s
name. He had only
met <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia
Bampton</span> the day
before, but already
from mere community
of literary
instincts they were
life-long friends.
She had reached the
trysting-place first.
All true modest
women do this.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;">
<a href="images/153.png"><img width="100%" src="images/153.png"
alt=""/></a>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Pseudonymia!</span>&quot;
said <span class="smcap">Perugino</span>,
blushing easily to
his finger-tips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Perugino!</span>&quot;
said <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>,
blushing to hers. It
was early, of course,
for Christian names,
but then the Terewth
had made them Free-and-Easy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Perugino!</span>&quot;
said <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>,
bringing her eyes
back from the infinite
to rest without
affectation on her
simple Greek chiton, &quot;I have often wanted to meet a real man who
had written a book with a key to it on the back of the cover. Now
tell me frankly some more beautiful things about our present loathsome
system of chartered monogamy, so degrading to my sex. Talk
straight on, please, pages at a time. Never mind about Probability.
Terewth is stranger than Probability; and the Terewth, you know,
shall make you Free!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Perugino</span> sank back into the spongy turf, leaning his cheek
against an upright spike of summer furze of the genus <i>Ulex
Europæus</i>. &quot;Some men,&quot; he began, &quot;ignoble souls, &#39;look about&#39;
them before they marry. Such are calculating egoists. Pure souls,
of finer paste, are, so to speak, <i>born married</i>. Others hesitate and
delay. The difficulties of teething, a paltry desire to be weaned
before the wedding, reluctance to being married in long clothes, the
terrors of croup during the honeymoon&mdash;these and other excuses,
thinly veiling hidden depths of depravity, are employed to defer the
divine moment. I have known men to reach the preposterously ripe
age of one-and-twenty unwedded, protesting that they dare not risk
their prospects at the Bar. These men can never mate like the
birds, never be guide-posts to point humanity along the path of
Terewth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; interrupted <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>, rose-red to her quivering
finger-tips with shame at the bare mention of marriage; &quot;but I
thought you disapproved of the debasing principle of wedlock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not interrupt,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Perugino</span>, kindly; &quot;I will come to that
two or three pages later on. To be prudent, I was going to say, is
to be vicious and cruel. Of course it is not given to all to be <i>born</i>
married. But this natal defect one can easily remedy. I knew a
young fellow who did. The indispensable complement crossed his
path before it was too late. He was still at his preparatory school;
<i>he married the matron</i>. True, there was disparity of age, but it was
a step in the right direction; though the head-master, a man of
common conventional ideas, gave the boy a severe rebuke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But to push on at once to contradictions. Marriage, I have said
elsewhere, is a degrading system, nurtured under the purple hangings
of the tents of iniquity. In <i>my</i> gospel Love, like Terewth,
should be Free; ever moving on, moving on. Now, Italy is the
home&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; cried <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>, &quot;Italy! That reminds me of sunburnt
Siena. What a wonderful Peruguinesque chapter that was in
your book. Like a leaf torn out of the live heart of <span class="smcap">Baedeker</span>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Italy,&quot; continued <span class="smcap">Perugino</span> doggedly, &quot;is the home of backgrounds.
I would like everyone to have a background&mdash;a past; the
more pasts the better. Is not that a beautiful thought? Ever
moving on to something different!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That has been the dream of my childhood,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>,
her white Cordelia-like soul thrilled through and through with
sacred convictions. A ripe gorse-pod burst in the basking sunlight.
(&quot;I never remember seeing sunlight bask before,&quot; she thought.) A
bumble-bee said something inaudible. &quot;But why,&quot; she added,
&quot;did you never give this pure sentiment to the world before? You
who have written so many many books?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My child,&quot; replied the artist, &quot;I was compelled to write down to
the public taste. One must consider one&#39;s prospects. This, you will
say, seems to clash with what I said before about calculating egoists.
But profession and practice are ever divorced under our depraved
system of civilisation. At last, having established myself, I rose
superior to sordid avarice, and wrote for once solely to satisfy my own
taste and conscience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A noble sacrifice!&quot; said <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>, suppressing her dimples
for the moment. &quot;As the physically weaker vessel, I could only
have done it under an assumed name. But tell me of one difficulty
which you have so cleverly avoided in your book. This question of
the family. Will not a confusion arise in another generation when
nobody quite knows who and how many his or her half-brothers and
half-sisters are?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Pseudonymia!</span>&quot; said <span class="smcap">Perugino</span>, and his voice broke in two
places, &quot;I am pained. I had thought that you, so pure, so
emancipate, would have had a soul above blithering detail. Besides,
do you not see that in this way the whole world will eventually
become one family? <i>We</i> may not live to see this Millennium, but
future Fabians may. What we want is a protomartyr in the cause.
<span class="smcap">Shelley</span> promised well, but he ultimately reverted to legal wedlock.
As for me, I have been deemed unworthy of the crown. I am, alas!
happily married. But you, you are single; why should you not set
to all your sister-slaves a high example of that martyrdom of which
the glory, as well as the inconvenience, has been denied to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, dear <span class="smcap">Perugino!</span>&quot; she cried, visibly affected for the third
time to her finger-tips, &quot;must it ever be so? Profession, as you say,
divorced from practice? Must one more noble name be added to the
list of those that shock the world so fearlessly with their books and
live such despicably blameless lives? I myself, too, am misleading
in print. You judged me by my pseudonymous publications to be
single and unscrupulous. But you were wrong. I also am unequal
to the weight of that crown. How can I be your martyr in the cause&mdash;I
who these many years have worshipped the very dust on which my
husband deigns to tread? Can you and I ever be forgiven for thus
sinning against the light?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Perugino</span> rose to go, indignant, disillusioned. &quot;<i>Et tu</i>, <span class="smcap">Pseudonymia</span>?&quot;
he bitterly cried. (She had been at Girton and could follow
the original.) &quot;Then I give you up. You are, I grieve to think, <i>a
woman who won&#39;t do</i>.&quot; And he made a she-note of it.</p>

<h2>&quot;WITH WHAT PORPOISE?&quot;</h2>

<p class="center">
[A porpoise has been seen gambolling in the Thames at Putney.]</p>

<p class="indent">Such a sea on at the North Foreland! Glad to get out of it. Nice
river coming down from somewhere. Must explore it.</p>

<p class="indent">Near some town. No end of oysters about. Oysters say it&#39;s
Whitstable. Seem dreadfully depressed. Ask them if the late cold
was too much for them? No, it&#39;s not that, they say, but injurious
stories have been circulated about them by medical men. Been called
&quot;typhoidal.&quot; Nobody patronises them, and they&#39;ve &quot;lost their
season in town.&quot; What do they mean?</p>

<p class="indent">Off Southend. Friendly sole advises me not to venture further.
&quot;Tempt not the Barking Outfall,&quot; he says, and adds that the
&quot;water at London will poison me, and I shall be made into boots.&quot;
London! Always wanted to see it. What&#39;s the good of being called
&quot;a kind of gregarious whale&quot; by the dictionaries if I avoid society?</p>

<p class="indent">Got past Barking safely! Who is it&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browning</span> I think&mdash;wrote a
poem about &quot;Sludge, the Medium.&quot; Must have written it near
Barking. Arrived off Wanstead Flats. See a respectable man on
banks being chivied by a mob. Told (by a sprat) that &quot;it&#39;s Mr.
<span class="smcap">Hills</span>, of the Thames Ironworks, who&#39;s been helping the unemployed.&quot;
Now the unemployed seem helping <i>him!</i> Tower Bridge rather fine.</p>

<p class="indent">Westminster. Big building. Curious scent in air. Told it&#39;s the
Houses of Parliament, and scent is eucalyptus, &quot;because of the
influenza.&quot; Curious word&mdash;wonder what it means.</p>

<p class="indent">Up at Putney. See University Boat-Race, if I can stay long
enough. Feel sleepy. Must be the amount of bad water I&#39;ve
drunk. Knock up against an ice-floe. Two men in boat try to
shoot me. <i>They</i> seem unemployed. Do they want to make me into
soup for the poor? Not if I know it. Trundle back seawards.
Meet a sea-gull. Says somebody tried to hook him from embankment.
Says he &quot;doesn&#39;t like London.&quot; Rather inclined to agree
with him.</p>

<p class="indent">Back at sea. Know now what influenza means&mdash;because <i>I&#39;ve
caught it!</i> Awful pains in my hide! Must consult a leech.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;What so interests you?&quot; asked the visitor. Replied the Baron,
&quot;<i>Japhet in Search of a Father</i>. I have not read it since my
school days.&quot; &quot;You find it old-fashioned, eh?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; answered
the Baron, &quot;the first few chapters are certainly old-fashioned, and
recall to my memory the italicised, punning style of <span class="smcap">Theodore
Hook</span> and of <i>Tom and Jerry</i>. But Captain <span class="smcap">Marryat</span> soon gets
away from this sort of thing; and when he has once fairly started
his hero and his companion on their adventures, the interest of
the story is never allowed to flag for a minute. I may add that I have
not enjoyed any modern story of adventure so much as I have this
one&mdash;always barring the romances of <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard</span>, <span class="smcap">Stephenson</span>,
&#39;<span class="smcap">Q.</span>,&#39; <span class="smcap">Shorthouse</span>, and <span class="smcap">Parker</span>&mdash;as there is about it an old
Georgian-era flavour, with its duels, its gambling-houses, its <i>Tom-and-Jerry</i>
episodes, its occasional drop into melodrama, its varied
characters of the period, its animal spirits and &#39;go,&#39; that makes it&mdash;to
me, at least&mdash;thoroughly fascinating.&quot; The illustrations, by
<span class="smcap">H. M. Brock</span>&mdash;which are specified as separately the property of
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>&mdash;bring vividly before the reader the manners
and customs of the time. &quot;In these days of morbid yellow-jaundiced
sensationalism, and of &#39;The New Woman,&#39; I am delighted,&quot;
quoth the Baron, &quot;to recommend, and strongly, too, this first of the
series of Captain <span class="smcap">Marryat&#39;s</span> works, now in course of republication
<i>chez</i> <span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>.&quot; The visitor thanked his noble friend, and
withdrew. Then the Baron finished the novel. &quot;Good!&quot; quoth
the Baron, closing the book with regret at parting with a long-forgotten
but now recovered friend; &quot;but &#39;tis odd how one lives and
learns. I do not remember having ever heard that <i>Bottom</i> the
weaver had been christened &#39;<span class="smcap">William</span>&#39; by <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>. Nor can
I find that bully <i>Bottom</i> was so addressed by his friends. And if I
have missed it, how came <span class="smcap">William</span> to be the <i>prénom</i> of the Athenian
weaver in the time of <i>Theseus</i> and <i>Hippolyta</i>! I should as soon
expect to discover that Hercules was known to his companions as
Henry Hercules. However, this by the way, and only <i>à propos</i> of
a remark as to <i>William Bottom</i>, the weaver, made by <span class="smcap">Marryat</span>.
I anticipate with pleasure re-making the acquaintance of <i>Jacob
Faithful</i> and <i>Midshipman Easy</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Banishment of Jessop Blythe</i>, written by <span class="smcap">Joseph Hatton</span>,
and published by <span class="smcap">Hutchinson</span>, belongs to the <i>Yellow Book</i> series,
only that is as far as the cover is concerned, which is of a startlingly
jaundiced tone and does not in the least represent the kindly author&#39;s
views of life. The story is about the ropemakers by one who clearly
&quot;knows the ropes.&quot; This industry, as will be gathered from the
present romance, is not confined to Ropemaker&#39;s Walk, E.C., but
was for two centuries carried on by Troglodytes or Cave-dwellers in
Derbyshire. The hero <i>Blythe</i> is turned out from the roping community
as a thriftless drunkard, emigrates, is poor and wretched, but
returns <i>Blythe</i> and gay, with a lot of money to find.... &quot;But
here,&quot; quoth the Baron, &quot;I must pause, or the surprise will be
heavily discounted, and the reader&#39;s pleasure spoilt. Thus far, no
farther. &#39;<i>Tolle; lege.</i>&#39;&quot; So recommended the</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 18.</i>&mdash;Navy
Estimates on again, with the First
Lord listening patiently from otherwise
empty Peers&#39; Gallery, and <span class="smcap">Robertson</span> making
admirable play from Treasury Bench. Chivalrous
soul of Cap&#39;en <span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span> moved
to admit that, after all, there had been worse
First Lords than <span class="smcap">Spencer</span>, and more uncivil
Lords than <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Private <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span>
thinks this is weakness. If his colleague in
charge of the Navy is to talk like that, he
(the Private) will be expected, when the Army
Estimates came on, to say something nice
about <span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>, to acknowledge
<span class="smcap">Woodall&#39;s</span> keen grip over the business of
his department, and the courtesy with which
he discharges his Ministerial duties.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Allan</span> o&#39;Gateshead on again with more
&quot;Rough Castings.&quot; Last time House in
Committee on Navy Estimates he spread
feeling of genuine alarm by denouncing the
British boiler. &quot;Who,&quot; he thundered, &quot;is
responsible for the engines of the Royal
Navy? Where is the <i>Hornet</i> you trumpeted
so loudly a year ago? Where,&quot; he continued,
bending beetling brows on Civil Lord of the
Admiralty, &quot;are her boilers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bust,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Gorst</span>, with guilty look.
Not that he had had anything to do with the
business, but because at this moment <span class="smcap">Allan</span>
o&#39;Gateshead chanced to fix a pair of flaming
eyes upon his shrinking figure, seated almost
immediately opposite at end of Front Bench.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the <i>Hornet</i> now? Why, lying
in Portsmouth Yard, with her boilers out of
her, a useless hulk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Allan</span> is so big, so burly, wears so much
hair, writes poetry, is understood to be in the
boiler business himself, and, withal, addresses
the Chairman with such terrific volume of
voice, that a panic might have ensued only
for <span class="smcap">John Penn</span>. <span class="smcap">Penn</span> head of great engineering
firm of old standing and high repute.
Understood to have engined fleet of five ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
with which <span class="smcap">Drake</span> made things hot for Spain along the coasts of
Chili and Peru. However that be, <span class="smcap">Penn</span> now made it hot for <span class="smcap">Allan</span>
o&#39;Gateshead. Showed in quite business-like fashion that <span class="smcap">Allan&#39;s</span>
poetic fancy had run away with him. Convinced grateful Committee
that British boiler, on which safety of State may be said to rest, is
all right. A model speech, brief, pointed. A man with something
to say, who straightway sits down when he&#39;s said it. As the poet
(not <span class="smcap">Allan</span> o&#39; Gateshead) says,</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>He came as a boon and a blessing to men,</p>
<p>The modest, the lucid, clear-pointed <span class="smcap">J. Penn</span>.</p>

<h3><i>MacGregor</i> (<i>as &quot;The Dougal Creature&quot;</i>). &quot;I&#39;ll
pass from that point.&quot;</h3>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Committee voted trifle over four millions as wages
for <span class="smcap">Jack</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Alderman <span class="smcap">Cotton</span>, once Lord Mayor of London, a prominent
and popular member of the <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span> Parliament, left behind
him the memory of one of those things we all would like to say if we
could. In the long series of debates on resolutions moved from Front
Opposition Bench challenging Jingo policy of the day, the Alderman
interposed. &quot;Sir,&quot; he said, &quot;this is a solemn moment. Looking
towards the East we perceive the crisis so imminent that it requires
only a spark to let slip the dogs of war.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That was, and remains, inimitable. But to-night the <span class="smcap">MacGregor</span>
came very near its
supreme excellence.
Stirred to profoundest
depths by demands
upon Naval
Expenditure. Popping
up and down
like piston in the
engine-room of Clyde
steamer; wrath
grew as <span class="smcap">Mellor</span>,
failing to see him,
called on other
speakers. The <span class="smcap">MacGregor</span>
knew all
about that; a reckless
corrupt Government,
afraid of
hearing the voice of
honest criticism, had
suborned Chairman
of Committees to
prevent his speaking.
But they didn&#39;t
know the <span class="smcap">MacGregor</span>.
After
something like two
hours physical exercise
in the way of
jumping up and
down he caught the
Chairman&#39;s eye, and
(in Parliamentary
sense, of course)
punched it. Then
&quot;passing from point
to point,&quot; as he airily put it, he went for <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>. Asked the
appalled Civil Lord of the Admiralty what he supposed his constituents
in Dundee would say when they read his speech, in which
bang went millions as if they were saxpences? &quot;What will the
worthy citizens say, Mr. <span class="smcap">Mellor</span>?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Why they will
say, &#39;Ma conscience!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Never since <i>Dominie Sampson</i> made this remark has so much
fervour and good Scotch accent been thrown in. &quot;Where&#39;s the
<span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>?&quot; <span class="smcap">MacGregor</span> presently asked,
evidently eager for fresh blood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That has nothing to do with the question,&quot; said the Chairman,
severely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, hasn&#39;t it?&quot; jeered the <span class="smcap">MacGregor</span>. &quot;I want to ask him
what he has done with our money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Vision instantly conjured up before eyes of Committee of <span class="smcap">Squire
of Malwood</span> prowling about town with his pockets loaded
with £4,132,500. voted to defray the charge for wages in the
Navy, flinging the cash about like <span class="smcap">Jack</span> ashore, making the most of
his time before Local Veto became the law of the land.</p>

<p class="indent">It was later that the <span class="smcap">MacGregor</span> came in unconscious competition
with Alderman <span class="smcap">Cotton</span>. Leaving the Navy for a moment he surveyed
the Continent of Europe peopled with armed men. &quot;Why!&quot; he
cried with comprehensive sweep of his arm, &quot;these great armies
are like fighting cocks. The least spark blows them up like magazines
of powder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not quite so good it will be seen as the Alderman, but good enough
for these degenerate days. Effect on Admiral <span class="smcap">Field</span> so exciting
that he was presently discovered chasing the <span class="smcap">Sage of Queen
Anne&#39;s Gate</span> all over House, desiring, as he said, to &quot;pin him to
his words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supplementary Estimates voted.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Curious to note the coyness with which House
approaches real business. To-day Welsh Disestablishment Bill comes
on for Second Reading. Its passing this stage a foregone conclusion.
The work of criticism, correction, possible re-moulding, will be done
in Committee. Committee is the Providence that shapes the ends of
Bills, rough hew them how we may in the draughtsman&#39;s hands or
on the second reading. For all practical purposes second-reading
debate might be concluded at to-night&#39;s sitting. It extended over
seven clear hours. Given twenty minutes per speech, the maximum
length for useful purposes, twenty-one members, more than the
House cares to hear, might have spoken. The time saved, if necessary,
added on to opportunity in Committee.</p>

<p class="indent">That, however, not the way we do business here. Disestablishment
Bill a measure of first importance; must be treated accordingly.
So after <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> talks for an hour and a quarter, <span class="smcap">Hicks-Beach</span>
caps him by speech hour and half long, which nearly empties House.
Afterwards a dreary night. Papers on subject read by Members,
who rise alternately from either side. Few listen; newspaper
reports cruelly curt; nevertheless, it&#39;s the thing to do, and will go
on through at least four sittings. On last night men whom
House want to hear will speak, as they might have spoken on first
night. Then the division, and minor Members who have missed
their chance will endeavour to work off their paper in Committee.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second reading Welsh Church Disestablishment
Bill moved.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Shall M.P.&#39;s be paid out of public purse? Dividing to-night
176 say Yes, 158 stern patriots say No. <span class="smcap">George Curzon</span>, fresh
from the Pamirs and still later from a sick bed, leads opposition.
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> is in favour of payment: darkly hints that
when the time comes he will find the cash. This, though a little
obscure, looks like business.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect,&quot; said the Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, &quot;we shall live to see the
day when, on Friday afternoons, Palace Yard will be crowded with
Members waiting to take their weekly money. Suppose they&#39;ll go
the whole hog, give us what the navvies call a &#39;sub,&#39; that is, let us
draw in middle of the week something on account. Of course we
shall have the full privilege of strikes. We&#39;ll &#39;go out&#39; if we think
our wages should be raised. Sure to be some blacklegs who will
skulk in by central lobby and offer to do a day&#39;s talking on the old
terms. But we&#39;ll have pickets and all that sort of thing. Sometimes
we&#39;ll march in a body to Hyde Park, and Baron <span class="smcap">Ferdy</span> will
address us from a waggon on the rights of man and the iniquity of
underpaying M.P.&#39;s. I see a high old time coming. Shall put in
early claim for a secretaryship. Always a good billet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Welsh Disestablishment Bill threw a gloom over
morning sitting. <span class="smcap">George Osborne Morgan</span>, supporting Bill, mentioned
that in episcopal circles he is regarded as &quot;a profligate&quot;!
There is, sometimes, a naughty look about him. But this is really
going too far, even for a bishop.</p>
